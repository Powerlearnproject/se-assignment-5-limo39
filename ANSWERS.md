Click on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D.

Click on the gear icon at the top of the Debug side bar to open the launch.json configuration file. If you don't have a launch.json file, VS Code will prompt you to select the environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.). Select the appropriate environment for your project.
VS Code will generate a default launch.json file with basic configuration. Customize this configuration as needed for your project.

Set Breakpoints:
Open the file you want to debug and click in the gutter (left margin) next to the line numbers to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear indicating a breakpoint.

Start Debugging:
Click the green play button at the top of the Debug side bar or press F5 to start debugging. The debugger will start and pause at the first breakpoint it hits.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code

Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints to pause the execution of your program at specific lines of code. You can also set conditional breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met.

Watch Variables:
Add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through your code. This helps you understand how variables change over time.

Call Stack:
View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program. This is useful for understanding the flow of execution and identifying the source of errors.

Step Controls:
Use the step controls to navigate through your code:
Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code but do not step into functions.
Step Into (F11): Step into the function called on the current line.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function and return to the caller.
Continue (F5): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.

Debug Console:
Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and execute commands while debugging. This allows you to interact with the program and inspect variables or output at runtime.

Variable Inspection:
Hover over variables in the editor while debugging to see their current values. This provides a quick and easy way to inspect the state of your variables.

Exception Handling:
Configure the debugger to break on exceptions. You can set it to break on all exceptions or only on uncaught exceptions. This helps in identifying and fixing errors.

Inline Values:
Display variable values inline within the editor during a debugging session. This provides a clear and immediate view of variable states without needing to look at separate panels.

10. Using Source Control:


Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
Initializing a Repository

Open Your Project Folder:

To stage a file, hover over it and click the + icon, or right-click the file and select Stage Changes. You can also stage all changes by clicking the + icon next to Changes.

Writing Commit Messages:
Once your changes are staged, a text box will appear at the top of the Source Control view for you to enter your commit message. Write a meaningful commit message describing the changes you made.

Committing Changes:
After writing your commit message, click the checkmark icon above the text box or press Ctrl+Enter to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub

Connecting to GitHub:
If your project is not already connected to a remote repository on GitHub, you need to set it up. You can do this by opening a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and using the following commands:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

Replace username with your GitHub username and repo with the name of your GitHub repository.

Pushing Changes:
Open the Source Control view. If you have committed changes that need to be pushed to the remote repository, you will see an upward arrow icon indicating the number of outgoing changes.
Click the upward arrow icon to push your changes to the remote repository, or use the terminal with the following command:

git push origin master

Replace master with the name of your branch if you are working on a different branch.
